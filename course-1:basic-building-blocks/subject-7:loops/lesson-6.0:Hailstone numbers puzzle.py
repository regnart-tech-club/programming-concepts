# Write a program that takes one input.
# While the number isn't 1,
# if the number is even, divide it by 2;
# Otherwise, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
# Have it output the number at each iteration and the number of iterations it takes to get to 1.
# For example, if the input is 7, the output would be:
# 22
# 11
# 34
# 17
# 52
# 26
# 13
# 40
# 20
# 10
# 5
# 16
# 8
# 4
# 2
# 1
# Number of iterations = 16
