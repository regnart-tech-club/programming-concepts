# The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1. Subsequent terms are then gotten by adding the previous two
# such that the first seven terms are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8.

# Using recursion, write a function that, given an integer n, returns the nth Fibonacci number.
# For example:
# given n = 0, the function should return 0
# if n = 1, it should return 1
# if n = 2, it should return 1
# if n = 4, it should return 3
# if n = 8, it should return 21
# Be sure to write automated tests for your solution.

# Hint:
# fibonacci(0) = 0
# fibonacci(1) = 1
# fibonacci(n) = fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
