# The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1. Subsequent terms are then gotten by adding the previous two
# such that the first seven terms are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8.

# Write a function that, given an integer n, returns the nth Fibonacci number.
# For example:
# given n = 0, the function should return 0
# if n = 1, it should return 1
# if n = 3, it should return 2
# if n = 5, it should return 5
# if n = 7, it should return 13
