# Using functions or lambdas as arguments and/or return values,
# write a program that takes in three inputs, two arguments and an operator
# then outputs the answer. For example, if the user enters '2', '+', '3',
# the program should output '5'. If the user enters '4', '*', '4',
# the program should output '16'.
