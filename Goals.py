# Rationale:
# * Learn computational thinking
#   * thought processes involved in formulating problems and their solutions
#     so that the solutions are represented in a form
#     that can be effectively carried out by an information-processing agent.
#   * compositional reasoning, pattern matching, procedural thinking, recursive thinking
#   * break down problems into smaller ones
#   * abstract
#     * power to scale and deal with complexity
#   * consider failure conditions and scenarios
#   * generalize solutions
# * form hypotheses
# * experiment
# * Be more productive, efficient, and effective
# * Computers are as much a part of today's life as is reading
#
# Introduce elementary school children to:
# * the concepts of programming (eg structural, object-oriented, functional)
# * good programming practices (eg TDD, DRY)
# * divide-and-conquer to solve problems
# * view problems in different ways (eg think of what can go wrong, break, etc)

# How do we achieve success?
# * Through having fun
# * the maximal level of performance for individuals in a given domain
#   is not attained automatically as a function of extended experience,
#   but the level of performance can be increased
#   even by highly experienced individuals
#   as a result of deliberate efforts to improve.
# * the most effective learning requires a well-defined task
#   with an appropriate difficulty level for the particular individual,
#   informative feedback, and opportunities for repetition and corrections of errors.
