# programming-concepts
Teaches programming concepts from the basics (eg variables, etc) to more advanced topics (eg higher-order functions).

This isn't a Python class, per se. In fact, some of the things covered will NOT be considered to be Pythonic by Pythonistas (eg `map`, `filter`, etc versus list comprehensions).
